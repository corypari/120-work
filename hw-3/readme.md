1. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

This week I downloaded a directory of files that included the file structure system for the p5 library as well as learned how to use HTML to link my JavaScript files. This allows us to create sketches and canvases in our browsers using these codes. I took steps to modify these documents, understanding their structures, and to learn how to properly use functions and parameters to draw.

2. Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these?

I actually felt comfortable in this weeks areas of study because it felt similar to the processing course I took. I am glad that this is a reminder though, as I definitely need it! I did not run into any issues other than initially not finding the correct folders displaying in my git repository, but I discovered I was just in the wrong root folder and fixed the issue. Now all of my files are correct.

3. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

I mostly just enjoyed one of the videos that showed us some of the cool ways p5 could be used in creative coding and want to explore this more so I can understand where to start focusing.
