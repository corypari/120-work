[Loops](https://github.com/corypari/120-work/tree/master/hw-8)

For this week, I toyed with the concepts of for, when, and more complex if loops. At first they were not making sense to me, as I tried to create a loop that would send my lines down a row each time it touches the wall. I at first struggled with this because the loops were not quite making sense to me and I did not know when to use each, but after playing with them for a few hours I finally understood when and where to use each type of loop, and what I might be able to do with it.

For the assignment, I created a similar array of lines as an example from the week. But instead of having it's lines meet in the middle, I decided to have it repeat line the ball example. This made is so I could create rows of lines with a nested for loop that redrew the X axis lines on a new Y axis each time it hit the wall. When the Y axis hits a wall, it also will stop.

After finally getting my lines to work, and tinkering with their placement to look cool, I used randomied values for the hue to create a more visually interesting piece. The lines strobe with color each frame. I also inversely moved a second line to blend with the first set of lines. This made the cool 'cone' shape.

I think I would love to learn more about specific uses for the for and while loops, because I still struggle to understand them when not in relationship to a previous example.
