1. This assignment I continued my theme of exploiting my unfortunate procrastination of online homework. I decided to use the algorythmic and mathematical funtions that we learned this week to create a graph that randomly generates plot points that represent various variables. I also bound the graph so that the points reset when one of them hits the end- but I could not get it to fully function perfectly.

2. I went through the materials thoroughly and played with them in Atom until I got a better understanding of objects, mapping, and redefining variables. I then came up with a way to represent my idea of a graph through algorythms.

3. I could not get my first graph points to continually update and add random Y values to move down slowly. But I eventually discovered that the problem was that I had my graph within the draw function instead of setup and it was covering them.

4. I do not fully understand what the potential of the mapping function is and would love to learn more of it. I mostly was confused by it.

5. I ran into my initial problem and it made me rage quit for a while out of frustration. I did not have time to help others, and was happy enough that I fixed my own problem finally so as to not add to others.
