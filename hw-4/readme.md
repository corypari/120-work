[Self Portrait]

1. This homework addition included me creating a self portrait after learning how the various 2D draw functions and shapes work. We primarily had to pay close attention to the layering and structure of the document, as we learned there is proper structural order of operations similar to in math. For my homework, I made a creative decision to come up with a concept of a portrait I think I could pull off using these shapes. This was my head as a balloon floating off into the clouds. I chose to primarily use lines and rounded rectangles to achieve most of my features. I had to structure the document so various of the shapes would layer properly behind each other.

2. To complete the assignment I created an entirely new directory within my Git, then created a new sketch.js that set up a canvas for my portrait. I then fiddled with various translation, style, and color properties to get it close to what I had in mind. I toyed with each variable until I got it right. I created Push / Pop structures to help me manage the various shapes I ended up drawing. I used Firefox's bug checker development tool to constantly check my progress and make tweaks.

3. The biggest problem I had was understanding how the grid worked, since its X and Y values were negative compared to a typical math grid. I ended up in a few situations not being able to draw shapes properly or in the right place because the grid had either been translated or was unfamiliar to me. I worked through this until I became more familiar with the idea however. I did not run into any issues that prevented my work from being done.

4. I would love to understand better why when we rotate shapes we do not just rotate it from it or its group's center point rather than from the 0,0 coordinate.

5. This cycle I answered a classmate's post who was looking for help understanding why his shapes were showing up in the wrong places, and sometimes not at all. I discovered with them that they had been using flipped coordinates and the objects were drawn off screen.
