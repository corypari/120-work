Cory Paringer MART 120 Section 51

# 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.

This homework cycle I primarily learned how to set up my Git repositories and manage them through both the GUI desktop app as well as the command promt. I also then learned the basics of the markup language formats used within Atom and Github. I learned how to push, pull and create repositories.

I also discovered and utilized a few resources to keep track of these new tools. I also created my own repository webpage directory. Importantly, I bookmarked these two webpages:

-[CoryPari GitHub](https://github.com/corypari/120-work)
-[Markup Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/corypari/120-work)

## 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

I followed the weeks course instructions and videos and did all of the TO-DO's for the session. This included:

1. Starting in command prompt to manually install Git repositories into my directory.
2. Practiced creating, changing, and updating my Git documents through a GUI like GitHub.
3. Practiced editing and creating markup language through Atom and the [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/corypari/120-work).

# 3. Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

The issues I did end up running in to were fortunately ones I could either google to find a result, or were eventually clarified as I read further into the weeks lectures. Primarily, I was initially confused by some of the language used in the command prompt portion of setting up Git. I learned after observation I was not separating some of the command lines properly so the result was neither command would go through. I did not have to post to the issues page but did consider it before finding the solution.
